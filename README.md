# Calculated Data Plugin for AvNav

This plugin calculates missing data from the data that is supplied to AvNav.

## Calculated Data

- magnetic variation - is calculated at current position based on the [World Magnetic Model](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model).
- true heading - from magnetic heading and variation
- set and drift - from ground track and water track
- depth below surface - from depth below transducer and configured depth of transducer
- true and ground wind - from apparent wind and course data
- TODO: leeway estimation

The formulas used for the calculation are best [read directly in the code](plugin.py:375).

All [calculated](plugin.py:282) and [input](plugin.py:32) values are available in AvNav under `gps.calculated.*`. It reads its input data from the AvNav data model, after NMEA parsing hase been done by AvNav.

It also can write [NMEA sentences](plugin.py:58), which are parsed by AvNav itself and are forwarded to NMEA outputs.

## Equations

### Heading

$$ HDT = HDM + VAR $$

### Leeway and Course

$$ LEE = LEF \cdot HEL / STW^2 $$
$$ CRS = HDT + LEE $$

With leeway factor \$LEF = 0..20\$, boat specific

### Course, Speed and Tide

$$ [SET,DFT] = [COG,SOG] \oplus [CRS,-STW] $$

### Wind

angles and directions are always converted like \$xWD = xWA + HDT\$

$$ [TWA,TWS] = [AWA,AWS] \oplus [LEE,-STW] $$
$$ [GWD,GWS] = [AWD,AWS] \oplus [COG,-SOG] $$

### Depth

$$ DBS = DBT + DOT$$

$$ DBK = DBS - DRT $$

The \$\oplus\$ operator denotes the [addition of polar vectors](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1365622/adding-two-polar-vectors).
